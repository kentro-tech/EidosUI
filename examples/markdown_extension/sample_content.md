# Custom Markdown Extensions

This example shows how to extend EidosUI's markdown renderer with custom syntax.

## Mentions

You can mention users like @alice or @bob, and they'll be styled and linked automatically.

Great work on this feature, @charlie! :star:

## Emoji Shortcuts

We've also added simple emoji shortcuts:

- :smile: = Happy face
- :heart: = Love it!
- :fire: = That's hot!
- :rocket: = Let's go!
- :check: = Done
- :x: = Not done
- :bulb: = Good idea!
